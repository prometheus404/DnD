| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1            | (1/81) Best possible situation. You're surrounded by friends.                                                                                                    |
| 2-5          | (4/81) This is a place of safety. many allies to be found here, though you'll have to jump a few hurdles to make use of them.                                    |
| 6-9          | (4/81) On the surface, a very receptive situation, but there's an agenda or traitor at work behind the scenes that could foul it all up                          |
| 10-15        | (6/81) You've got multiple inroads here, friends who will watch your back, but the obstacles are many, and sussing out who your friends are won't always be easy |
| 16-19        | (4-81) A sympathetic ear hides behind a wall of apathy and disinterest. Where hides your ally?                                                                   |
| 20-31        | (12/81) Your point of view is most strongly represented here, but loud minorities persist, some preaching opposition, others isolationism                        |
| 32-37        | (6/81) Carefully balanced tension. The end result is neutral, but only because both sides are pulling equally strong at the center. Will you tip the balance?    |
| 38-49        | (12/81) Open market. You could lose your shirt, or find a great deal, but mostly you'll just find what you need... if you can pay for it                         |
| 50           | Utter apathy and bureaucratic paralysis. It's like climbing a mountain. The mountain doesn't care if you reach the top or you fall. It's just there              |
| 51-62        | (12/81) An unfriendly climate. The opposition is well-represented here, and the voices that might speak against them are playing their cards carefully           |
| 63-66        | (4/81) For now the gathering seems to have taken little interest in you. But angry eyes watch you from hiding, waiting for the moment to strike                  |
| 67-70        | (4/81) Your ally is beset on all sides by detractors and those who wish to do her harm. You're needed here, but will your help be enough?                        |
| 71-76        | (6/81) Cold, unfeeling, and more than a little hostile. There are no friends here, and plenty are willing to look the other way while evil does its deeds.       |
| 77-80        | (4/81) The walls are closing in. You might yet have a way to get out of this mess but it's going to come at a price.                                             |
| 81           | The knives are out. Every bad thing that could come to a head and ruin your day, just did.                                                                       |
